# FORTRAN

Fortran is a general-purpose programming language that is dominant in scientific computing applications. It's the leading language used in high performance (HPC) and parallel programming. While Fortran is the oldest high-level programming language, it is constantly improving. Fortran 2008 added native support for parallel programming on both shared and distributed memory architectures, and is one of few languages used for next-generation exascale HPC applications. The most recent revision of the standard, Fortran 2018, brings additional parallel features such as teams and events, and improved interoperability with C. [Curcic, 2018](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-fortran)

A few Fortran facts:

*    If you read or listened to the weather forecast this morning, you used Fortran.
*    You'll find Fortran at the lowest levels of most popular data analysis and machine learning frameworks.
*    Fortran is the reference benchmark language used to measure the performance of the fastest supercomputers in the world (https://top500.org)
*    Fortran is the only natively-parallel programming language steered by an International Standards Committee with scientists and engineers as its target audience.
*    Fortran is the dominant language of the High Performance Computing, spanning industries from applied mathematics, fluid and aerodynamics, to weather, ocean, and climate prediction.

Simply put, the future is in parallel, and Fortran is already there.

### Fortran 95

I learned Fortran 95 back there in 2006 using the "[Fortran 90/95 for Scientists and Engineers 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0072825758/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i7)" [COVER](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-%2BXunL39L._SX386_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg).  In my opinion, this book is the best book to learn Fortran 95 because it provides a complete material about this language and many very good exercises. Just read the book and solve the exercises. This would be enough to make you a good Fortran 95 programmer. Ok, at least teach you all you need for academical purposes.
