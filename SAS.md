# SAS code for common data analysis

# Compilation

1. [SAS Code Example](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~aa/cda/Sas_web.pdf)

The examples in this appendix show SAS code for version 9.3.  We focus on basic model fitting rather than the great variety of options.  For more detail, see
Stokes,  Davis,  and  Koch  (2012) Categorical Data Analysis Using SAS ,  3rd  ed. Cary, NC: SAS Institute. Allison (2012) Logistic Regression Using SAS: Theory and Application,
2nd edition. Cary, NC: SAS Institute.
For examples of categorical data analyses with SAS for many data sets in my text An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, see the useful site www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/examples/icda/ set up by the UCLA Statistical Computing Center.  A useful SAS site on-line with
details about the options as well as many examples for each PROC is at support.sas.com/rnd/app/da/stat/procedures/CategoricalDataAnalysis.html
